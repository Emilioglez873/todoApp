#  OWL Tutorial: TodoApp 

For this tutorial, we will build a very simple Todo list application. The app
should satisfy the following requirements:

- let the user create and remove tasks
- tasks can be marked as completed
- tasks can be filtered to display active/completed tasks

This project will be an opportunity to discover and learn some important Owl
concepts, such as components, store, and how to organize an application.
